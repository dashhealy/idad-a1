          Immediately, both sites map their information completely differently.
          Inter-Symmetry presents the user with a minimalistic, spacious, clean
          interface. All tools and functions of the synthesizer are shown, with
          some elements even being labelled for further clarification (sound,
          pitch, length etc.) with a simple, readable, serif font. Because of
          this no-nonsense design philosophy, users immediately understand how
          the synthesizer functions and works. On the other hand, Limp Body Beat
          obscures these functions, instead placing the user’s focus on the
          large, flailing, gooey body on screen. The actual synthesizer is
          almost hidden, placed in the top left corner on an angle,
          semi-transparent and much smaller than the body. This effect is
          enhanced by the clay-like, meaty environment it’s in, which adds more
          visual noise to an already chaotic website. Additionally, the
          different “instruments” aren’t labelled as instruments. Instead,
          different heads are shown, depicting the different bodies that can be
          placed on screen. The user can only discover these features, the
          sounds they make and how they work after playing around. Limp Body
          Beat allows users to let their curiosity to guide them around the
          different elements of the site. This is in stark contrast to
          Inter-Symmetry, which instead gives the user all the information they
          need right from the start.

          The feedback design of these websites also differ. Inter-Symmetric
          focuses on immediate, flat, no-nonsense feedback loop. When a button
          is pressed, a dial is turned, or a slide moved the music instantly
          changes to reflect the user’s input. On the other hand, Limp Body
          Beats delays audio feedback, requiring two things. First, unlike
          Inter-Symmetry, Limp Body Beat’s synthesizer waits to make changes to
          the music until the loop reaches the changes made. Second, the user
          needs to physically move the body to hit the notes, unlike the
          Inter-Symmetry’s auto-play. By using unorthodox and obtuse controls,
          Limp Body Beat strays from Inter-Symmetry’s straight-forward feedback
          loop, delaying feedback, and requiring more input and interaction from
          the user.

          All the design choices brought up all seek to establish and reinforce
          the character of these sites to the user. The clean, clear, plain
          mapping and information design of Inter-Symmetry immediately sets the
          user’s expectations for what the site is. It will provide a pleasant
          sound, a small but hearty range of tools and a simplistic, normal
          experience. The same goes for the feedback loop it presents, again
          reinforcing the simple, no-nonsense tone the user now expects from a
          site that looks like Inter-Symmetry. Contrasting this, Limp Body Beat
          instead sets an opposite tone. With chaotic visuals, unorthodox
          mapping and cluttered, odd information design, the user instead
          expects a more unorthodox experience. This is then reinforced by the
          harsh sounds the synthesizer plays, and the delayed, input-reliant
          feedback of the website, which further establishes Limp Body Beat as a
          toy or “experience” as opposed to a professional or pleasant
          instrument like Inter-Symmetry.
